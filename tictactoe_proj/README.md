# Tic-Tac-Toe

## About
This app is an introductory project to Swift. This project is optimized to display on the regular iPhones 6 and 7. I believe the display is also correct on the iPhones 5 and SE. Since the game itself is very basic, the project mainly serves to showcase my UI/UX design skills.

## How to Run
You can download the repo and run the Xcode project from the "Tic-Tac-Toe" directory. The best emulators to run the project in are the iPhones 6 and 7.
